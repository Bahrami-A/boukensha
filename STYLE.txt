naming convection:
    abstract class names: abstractclassname, all lower case
    base class: baseclassname, same as abstract class
    sub class name: SubClassName, words start with upper case
    method names: method_name, all lower case underscore between words
    public variable names: variable_name, same as method name
    protected variable names: _protected_variable_name, same as public variable name but starts with a underscore
    private variable names: __private_variable_name, same as public variable name but starts with two underscores
    file names: filename, sane as abstract class name


object development process:
    (optional)abstract class -> base class -> subclass instantiation -> main

hierarchy:
    if possible, change if needed
        Game super class
            view
            map
            objects
